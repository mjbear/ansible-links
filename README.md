Remove the overhead associated with maintaining database backups or expensive replication solutions while enabling disaster recovery and failover. 
- [Clustering](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/clustering.html#clustering): Clustering is sharing load between hosts. Each instance should be able to act as an entry point for UI and API access.
